# ModelPorscheFlatSixEngine
Simple 3D printable model of a flat six engine without engine heads

After learning AutoCAD at the start of my summer holidays, I wanted to make use of it and decided to make a model engine. I designed the parts around the below bearings:

- Main crankshaft bearings - 6003ZZ
- ⁠Con-rod bearings (bottom) - 609ZZ
- ⁠Con-rod bearings (top) - 603ZZ

However, if you can find appropriately sized bushings, and can modify the files to fit, that would be a better approach. 

I then exported the AutoCAD drawings as ‘stl’ files, which have also been uploaded in this github repo. I then sliced them using UltiMaker Cura and printed them on a Creality Ender-3 3D printer.
